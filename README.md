PhyloFunc: Phylogeny-informed Functional Distance as a New Ecological Metric for Metaproteomic Data Analysis

The data is stored in three folders: 'toy database', 'human gut microbiome dataset', and 'mouse gut microbiome dataset'. Each folder contains the dataset, code, and output results corresponding to each example in the article.

PhyloFunc is presented with example data through a series of Python code. The code can be run through an Spyder with a user's own data, or can be customized using modular scripts.
The plots can be visualized using the R scripts using the data from our manuscript. The code for all figures is also included.
